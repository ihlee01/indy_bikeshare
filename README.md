==============

Android app for Indiana Pacers Bikeshare system.


1.	User Interface: the current UI(Design, how it looks) is not very user-friendly, and it would be good to change it so it looks better and smoother.
2.	Login/Sign up: Currently bikeshare users can’t sign up or log in into the app. We believe this will help users who are more mobile-friendly and would like to use their phones to sign up/login.
3.	Find Dock: A feature that will tell bikers how close the next dock station is based on their current location.
4.	Bookmark/Favorite: For when the user constantly uses a certain dock, they can bookmark it or add it to their favorites for easy access.
5.	Notification system: If a user is planning to go to a certain dock, there could be a notification telling them whenever or not the dock is available. Additionally, you could add a “suggest alternative dock”. This will be very helpful, especially during lunch hours where certain docks always get full because of it.
6.	Timer: Instead of keeping track from our own, it will be nice to have a timer added to remind us how much time we have left. Ex. A five minute warning.
7.	Reservation: a later feature that will allow users to reserve a spot in their favorite dock for 15-30min and open it up to others if they don’t get there by that time.
